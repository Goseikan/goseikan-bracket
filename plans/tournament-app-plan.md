## Tournament Settings Management

### Super Admin Tournament Configuration
The tournament settings system allows super administrators to configure key tournament parameters that affect the entire tournament structure and gameplay.

#### Key Settings:
1. **Seed Stage Configuration**
   - Enable/disable initial seed round robin stage
   - Set maximum teams per group (default: 4)
   - Control group generation logic

2. **Team Size Configuration**
   - Set number of players per team (default: 5, previously hardcoded to 7)
   - Dynamically applied across all components:
     - Team roster management
     - Match result reporting
     - Individual match slots
     - Team lineup displays

3. **Tournament Structure**
   - Main bracket type (single or double elimination)
   - Number of qualifying teams per seed group
   - Overtime functionality toggle
   - Match progression rules

#### Implementation Impact:
- **DojoManagement**: Dynamic position count based on `playersPerTeam` setting
- **MatchResultModal**: Variable individual match slots (1-N instead of hardcoded 1-7)
- **BracketVisualization**: Responsive to group size settings
- **Team displays**: Show N positions instead of fixed 7
- **Database**: Migration required for existing teams with 7-player structure

#### Migration Strategy:
1. Add tournament settings table/interface
2. Create super admin settings management UI
3. Update all components to read from tournament settings
4. Migrate existing data to support variable team sizes
5. Validate and test with different configurations
