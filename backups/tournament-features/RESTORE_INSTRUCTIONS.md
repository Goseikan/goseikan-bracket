### Page Components

## How to Restore Tournament Features

1. **Restore Core App Structure:**
   ```bash
   cp backups/tournament-features/App.tsx.backup src/App.tsx
   cp backups/tournament-features/Navigation.tsx.backup src/components/Navigation.tsx
   cp backups/tournament-features/HomePage.tsx.backup src/pages/HomePage.tsx
   ```

2. **Restore Dashboard and Admin:**
   ```bash
   cp backups/tournament-features/DashboardPage.tsx.backup src/pages/DashboardPage.tsx
   cp backups/tournament-features/AdminPage.tsx.backup src/pages/AdminPage.tsx
   ```

3. **Verify all tournament components are in place:**
   - Tournament pages should already exist in src/pages/
   - Tournament components should already exist in src/components/
   - If any are missing, copy from this backup directory

4. **Test tournament functionality:**
   - Check routing to all tournament pages
   - Verify bracket generation and visualization
   - Test match result recording
   - Confirm court management works

## Registration-Only Changes Made

The following changes were made to focus the app on registration:

- Removed tournament routes from App.tsx (bracket, participants, courts)
- Simplified Navigation to show only registration-focused menu items
- Redesigned HomePage to emphasize registration over tournament status
- Streamlined DashboardPage for registration management
- Disabled tournament controls in AdminPage
- Maintained all user, team, and dojo management functionality

## Notes

- Database schema was left intact to support easy restoration
- Authentication and authorization systems remain unchanged
- All tournament logic components are preserved but not imported
- TournamentContext state management was modified but can be restored

To restore the full tournament functionality, simply restore the backed up files and ensure all tournament components are properly imported and routed.
